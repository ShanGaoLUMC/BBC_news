West Ham crisis not over yet - but they have a system that works - Leon Osman

I was impressed by the way West Ham beat Everton on Sunday to pick up their first points of the season, but I would not say winning one game means any crisis is over for them.

Before the game, the Hammers were under massive pressure after losing their first four Premier League matches, and they were the only team in the top four divisions in England not to have a single point.

Another defeat would have made it their worst start to the season in the club's 123-year history, and there was talk manager Manuel Pellegrini was facing the sack after spending Â£100m to revamp his squad over the summer.

Considering all of that, the result West Ham got at Goodison Park was huge, and the level of the performance they produced to get it will have given them massive encouragement.

My only worry if I was in their dressing room would be to make sure that their players maintain it.

If I was West Ham captain Mark Noble, or another senior player, I would be looking around the room and saying: 'You have shown me what you can do now, but that cannot be a one-off - you have to do that every single game.'

It is up to them to start delivering, because before Sunday they had been quite flaky this season.

Now they have shown the standard they can perform at over 90 minutes, they need to do that consistently!
