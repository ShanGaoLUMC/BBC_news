Toronto Film Festival: Keira Knightley criticises period drama 'negativity'

Period dramas are not thought "serious" because they tend to focus on women characters, claims Keira Knightley.

"There's a negativity around them because predominantly they're female," she said at the Toronto Film Festival.

The British star of Atonement, Pride and Prejudice and The Imitation Game is back in period garb in Colette, a biopic of the French novelist.

She said she had often considered swearing off the genre, only to be lured back by strong scripts.

"The strongest characters I've found have been in period roles," said the 33-year-old, whose other films include four entries in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.

"I also like the idea of breathing life back into what is gone. In a funny way, it's resurrecting the dead."

Colette concentrates on the early years of the writer born Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette in January 1873.

Central to its plot is her relationship with her first husband Henry Gauthier-Villars, who wrote extensively under the titter-inducing pseudonym Willy.

The film sees Willy, played fulsomely by Dominic West, encouraging Colette to write successful novels only to take the credit for her accomplishments.

It also addresses her sexual dalliances with lovers of all genders and her ventures into flamboyant live performance.

Knightley said she "instantly felt connected" to the writer's history, which she found "very relevant" to current discussions about gender roles.

"It's the story of a woman who's finding her voice and her true self and allowing herself to live courageously," she went on.

"I stood very tall when I played Colette," added the actress. "She was a maverick."
