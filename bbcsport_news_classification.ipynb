    "This script is trying to build a predictive model to automatically label the category for each news article. The raw text files are download from http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html. The main procedure has the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a dataframe storing all news data.\n",
    "2. Clean and preprocess the raw texts (e.g. remove non-words, word stemming). Create training and test datasets.\n",
    "3. Convert each news article to a feature vector using bag-of-word approach.\n",
    "4. Build a classification pipeline which includes vectorizer, featureSelection, and classifier. \n",
    "5. Train the pipeline with training sets, turn the model parameters.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the trained model. Apply the optimized model to the test datasets for category prediction. Calculate classifcaition accuracy, consufion matrix.\n",
    "7. Take some interesting news from BBC website, preprocess them, and input them to optimized model to see how does the model works. \n",

    "RESULTS:\n",

    "Prediction accuracy of Training set: 0.998\n",

    "## 4. Conclusions\n",
    "In this script, a preditive model for automatic bbcsport news classification is developed and evaluated. The process pipeline include: (1) clean the raw text data; (2) extract tf-idf features from cleaned text; (3) select best features using chi-square test; (4) train and apply the linear SVM model to predict the category for unseen news documents. Optimal setting is seached by turning the important parameters of the model, obtaining a classification accuracy of 97%.\n",

    "In future, it would be interesting to try out different classifiers, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, etc. "
